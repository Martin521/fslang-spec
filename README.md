# F# Language Specification

## Overview

This is an initiative to create a more complete and community-maintainable F# specification.

You can view the current version of the specification [here](https://fsharp.github.io/fslang-spec/introduction/).

The maintained source of the spec is a collection of markdown files (one per chapter) in the `spec` folder of this repo.

## Contributing

Integration of the remaining RFCs is no small task, but we believe it is worthwhile and we count on community contributions.

- If you feel you can turn one of the open RFCs into spec language, please create a PR with the corresponding changes to the respective chapter(s). We recommend you open an issue first, indicating you want to tackle that PR, to avoid double work. 

  You can find the list of open and completed RFCs [here](https://fsharp.github.io/fslang-spec/rfc-status/).

- If you find typos or other small mistakes in the spec, please open an issue and preferably also a corresponding PR.

For more details, see [this](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

## Review Process

The spec is in the end closely coupled to the language design and therefore needs a) strong community contributions and b) a clearly defined final responsibility, which will be similar to the one of the [language design process](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design?tab=readme-ov-file#who-is-in-charge).

All PRs need to be accepted by two reviewers with write access for merging.
